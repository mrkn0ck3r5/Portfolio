                      <h2>Mischief Brand 2016-Present</h2>
                      <p>Mischief is a brand I created while in Fresno State. The point of this brand is self representation of yourself at the cost of being judged. It was meant to be rebellious and fun. I was instructed to create mock-ups and color styles for the logo and the work I did can be accessed by clicking the logo.

                      <h2>Self-taught Game Dev 2016-Present</h2>
                      <p>After finding out my passion I decided to express it by
                          learning how to make classic games through YouTube 
                          tutorials. I've had fun learning how to make them and 
                          appreciate the processes involved with making a game. If you were to click on one of the images you can play 
                          these games. They were made using p5.js a javascript library and a web editor.

                          <p>
                              I met many individuals that would help me learn how games within the industry work and record my progress on YouTube. I enjoy tinkering and editing code/assets.
